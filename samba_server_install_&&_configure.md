## How to install and configure samba server in linux

##### _Note: This tutorial was tested on Ubuntu 18.04, other Linux OS should have similar concepts_

### Steps :
1. Use either an ethernet cable to connect a Ubuntu *host machine* running samba server and a *client machine* (client can be anything a linux or a windows machine) or a local home router. The idea is that the host and the client should be on a same local area network (LAN).
2. Follow the steps in [this tutorial](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/install-and-configure-samba#0) for further steps.
3. Enjoy and easy file server.
