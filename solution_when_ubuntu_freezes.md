### What to do when Ubuntu freezes?
* You can perform these keypresses together and one after another - <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>SysReq (Print Screen)</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>
>R:  Switch to XLATE mode <br>
  E:  Send Terminate signal to all processes except for init <br>
  I:  Send Kill signal to all processes except for init <br>
  S:  Sync all mounted file-systems <br>
  U:  Remount file-systems as read-only <br>
  B:  Reboot

>Just as an information : *REISUB* is *BUSIER* backwards, as in "The System is busier than it should be", if you need to remember it. Or mnemonically - *R* eboot; *E* ven; *I* f; *S* ystem; *U* tterly; *B* roken.
