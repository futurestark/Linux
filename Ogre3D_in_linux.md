### How to install [Ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/) in Linux?

##### _Note: This documentation was written in relation to host Ubuntu 18.04, but should be similarly working with other linux OS's too._

### An easy installation method:
1. Ubuntu comes with a particular version of Ogre3D that can be installed easily - [reference](https://codeyarns.com/2017/04/17/how-to-build-ogre-in-ubuntu/).
  - Install this package for the same : `sudo apt-get install libogre-1.9-dev`.
  
### Building [Ogre3D from source](https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre) - _Still trying to find a solid way for this, Let's keep trying_:
1. Install machine I am using Ubuntu 18.04.
2. I have been using following resources:
  - [Codeyarns - how to build ogre in ubuntu](https://codeyarns.com/2017/04/17/how-to-build-ogre-in-ubuntu/).
  - [Official Ogre Wiki Build guide](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/api/latest/building-ogre.html). Followed with [setting up ogre application](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~cpresser/cs391/software/ogre_eclipse_project_linux.html).
  - [Gettysburg.edu - Setting up OGRE for Linux](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~cpresser/cs391/software/ogre_eclipse_project_linux.html) - can skip the eclipse part if not needed.
  - [Some other resource from unixmen](https://www.unixmen.com/how-to-install-ogre-in-linux/).
